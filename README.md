Text Hider
=================================

# Introduction

You can hide any text quickly and randomly into another text composed of A-Z characters.

This application uses [MagicStringHider](https://github.com/magiclen/MagicStringHider "String Hider") library to hide/unhide any text. You can also add an optional key to protect your text.

## Why and when do you need this app?

If you want to send some sensitive or private messages to someone via the Internet(Maybe some social networking sites, such as Facebook, Skype and Line.), you must ensure your messages will not be leaked. So, you need this application to hide your messages and send the hidden messages out.
